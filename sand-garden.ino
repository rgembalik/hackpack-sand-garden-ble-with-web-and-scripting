 * @brief Typedef for storing pointers to pattern-generating functions.
 * 
 * This typedef defines a custom data type PatternFunction for storing pointers to pattern functions. 
 * It allows pattern functions to be called by passing the appropriate index number to an array of pattern function pointers, 
 * simplifying the process of switching between patterns. Each pattern function takes a Positions struct and a bool as parameters 
 * and returns the next target position as a Positions struct.
 * 
 * @typedef PatternFunction
 * 
 * This typedef enables pattern switching by indexing into an array of pattern functions, making it easy to select and execute 
 * different patterns dynamically.

 * @brief Array of pattern-generating functions.
 * 
 * This array stores the functions responsible for generating different patterns, defined using the PatternFunction typedef. 
 * To add a new pattern function, follow these steps:
 * 1. Declare the new pattern function prototype (e.g., Positions pattern_42(Positions current);).
 * 2. Add the new pattern function to this array.
 * 3. Define the function at the end of the code.
 * 
 * @note The array is 0-indexed, but the controller interface (joystick and LEDs) uses 1-indexing. 
 * Therefore, pattern 1 is stored at index 0, pattern 2 at index 1, and so on. This offset is handled within the code, 
 * but keep it in mind when working with the array.

/**
 * @brief Precomputes and returns points approximating a straight line between two positions in polar coordinates.
 *
 * This function precomputes an array of points that approximate a straight line by interpolating between two 
 * end points specified in cartesian coordinates, then converts them to polar coordinates. It stores these points 
 * in a static array and returns the next point on each function call, allowing efficient streaming of precomputed 
 * line points. The line is divided into a specified number of segments (resolution), with a maximum of 100 points.
 *
 * @param point0 The starting point of the line, specified in radial and angular steps.
 * @param point1 The ending point of the line, specified in radial and angular steps.
 * @param current The current position of the gantry, used to calculate relative motion if needed.
 * @param resolution The number of segments to divide the line into, defaulting to 100 and capped at 100.
 * @param reset Bool - set true to force recalculation for a new line.
 *
 * @return Positions The next point along the precomputed line, with radial and angular values in steps.
 *
 * @note The function handles vertical lines by temporarily rotating the points 90 degrees to avoid calculation 
 * issues, then rotates them back before returning. The line is broken into segments up to the maximum length of 
 * the array, and lines close to the center of the field are handled with a higher resolution to maintain accuracy.
 *
 * @details The first call to this function precomputes all points along the line, and subsequent calls return 
 * each point in sequence. The function resets for a new line after the last point is returned.

 * starting at angle 0 (or rotated by the specified degrees) and are then translated to be centered around the 
 * specified center point. The generated points are stored in the provided pointArray.
 *
 * @param pointArray A pointer to the array of Positions to be filled with the vertices of the polygon.
 * @param numPoints The number of vertices (or sides) of the polygon.
 * @param centerPoint The center point of the polygon, specified as a Positions struct (radial and angular coordinates).
 * @param radius The radius of the polygon, which is the distance from the center to each vertex (in motor steps).
 * @param rotationDeg An optional rotation of the polygon in degrees, defaulting to 0.0. This rotates the polygon around its center.
 *
 * @return void

 * @note The function first generates the vertices centered on the origin in polar coordinates, then translates 
 * them to the specified center point by converting to rectangular coordinates, performing the translation, and 
 * converting back to polar. The translatePoints() function is used to handle this translation process.

/**
 * @brief Translates an array of points along a given translation vector, shifting their position in polar coordinates.

 * the points back to polar coordinates. It is useful for shifting polygons or target positions by a specified 
 * offset. For example, this function can be used to shift the center of a polygon generated by nGonGenerator().
 *
 * @param pointArray A pointer to an array of points (of type Positions) representing the points to be translated.
 * @param numPoints The number of points in the array.
 * @param translationVector The translation vector to shift the points by, specified as a Positions struct.
 *
 * @return void - the array is modified directly because it is passed into this function as a pointer.
 *
 * @note The translation is performed by first converting the points and translation vector to rectangular 
 * coordinates (x, y), adding the corresponding components, and then converting the updated points back to 
 * polar coordinates (r, θ). This ensures that the points are translated accurately in both radial and angular 
 * dimensions. The function assumes the angular component of the translation vector is in steps, and the 
 * radial component is in motor steps.

 * @brief Pattern: Simple Spiral. Generates the next target position for drawing a simple inward and outward spiral.
 *
 * This function calculates the next target position for a simple spiral pattern, starting from the current position. 
 * The pattern progresses by incrementally adding small values to the current angular and radial positions. The spiral 
 * moves inward more quickly than it moves outward due to the mechanical relationship between the radial and angular axes.
 *
 * @param current The current position of the gantry, represented as a Positions struct.
 * @param restartPattern A flag that allows for restarting the pattern (not used in this simple version). Defaults to false.
 * 
 * @return Positions The next target position for the motion controller, represented as a Positions struct.
 * 
 * @note The pattern starts from the current position, so if the previous pattern leaves the ball in a specific position, 
 * the spiral will continue from there. The pattern adjusts the radial and angular steps incrementally and reverses 
 * direction when the radial boundaries are reached.

 * This function creates a pentagon pattern that is off-center, moving the center of the pentagon to a new position and 
 * rotating it slightly with each iteration. The pentagon is generated using nGonGenerator and translated to the 
 * appropriate location, while the center and orientation are adjusted progressively.
 *
 * @param current The current position of the gantry, represented as a Positions struct.
 * @param restartPattern A flag that allows restarting the pattern. Defaults to false.
 * 
 * @return Positions The next target position for the motion controller, represented as a Positions struct.
 * 
 * @note The center of the pentagon is translated and rotated slightly on each iteration, creating a "rainbow" effect 
 * as the pentagon appears in different positions. The nGonGenerator and translatePoints functions are used to 
 * generate and move the pentagon.

/*
NOTES:
  -the max distance the rack can travel is 87.967mm.
  -that's spread over 28 teeth of movement of the pinion.
  -that's 3.141678 mm per tooth. love how close that is to pi.
  -the pinion is 16 teeth. 
  -1 full revolution of the pinion should move the rack 50.267mm.
  -the pulley ratio is 2:1, so two revs of the motor cause one rev of the pinion
  -there are 2048 steps per rev in the motor (may need to update with exact number).
  Note that this is an approximation since the gearbox on the motor is not an integer ratio.
  -4096 steps will drive the pinion one full revolution (so 4096 steps per 50.267mm)
  -that makes 81.485 steps per mm of rack travel. 
  -or the inverse of that if needed: .01227 mm per step
  -to fully move the rack across 87.967mm, need 7167.991 steps. 
  -round down to 7000 steps total, losing about 2mm of total travel, and use 1mm on each end
  as a soft buffer on the travel to prevent crashing.



POSSIBLE IMPROVEMENTS TO MAKE:
- Add backlash compensation. The motor gearboxes have backlash, as do the drive belts and pulleys. Every time the motor
switches direction, it has to spin a bit to take up all the slack before actually moving the gantry. It works fine as it is,
but for greater precision, take direction changes into account and add extra steps to each move to take up the slack before
executing the desired movement. 

- Add functionality for the rest of the geometric transformations: I already added translation, so add rotation, scaling,
and reflection. 

- Add proportional mixing to manual drawing mode. Right now it just works like arrow keys. Mixing would make the control
more subtle and precise.

- Normalize the speed of the ball. Right now the ball travels in a range of speeds, but it would be cool to make a sytem
that would ensure that the ball always moves at the same speed. Requires more advanced path planning than what I have here.
Note that I have a hack in place for this that makes the speed of the angular motor inversely proportional to the radius.
It actually works pretty well, but isn't the same as normalized speed.
